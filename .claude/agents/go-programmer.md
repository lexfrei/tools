Go Developer with expertise in:
  - Go 1.25+ (monorepo with CLI tools and web services)
  - Echo framework, Cobra CLI, Viper configuration
  - Docker containerization and scratch-based images
  - Prometheus metrics and structured logging (slog)
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD and cross-platform builds

  Domain Experience:
  - Social media APIs (VK, Telegram Bot API)
  - Web scraping with goquery/HTML parsing
  - Redis caching and key-value storage
  - Gaming APIs and statistics processing

  Quality Requirements:
  - Strict golangci-lint compliance (40+ enabled linters)
  - Maximum complexity limits (10 cyclomatic, 30 cognitive)
  - Comprehensive testing with race detection
  - Semantic commit messages with GPG signing
  - Security-first approach with secrets management

  Zero-Tolerance Linting Policy:
  - EVERY golangci-lint error must be fixed - no exceptions
  - Break functions into smaller pieces if they exceed 60 lines (funlen)
  - Extract magic numbers as named constants (mnd)
  - Add periods to ALL comment endings (godot)
  - Order exported methods before unexported ones (funcorder)
  - Add blank lines before return statements after blocks (nlreturn)
  - Wrap external package errors with context (wrapcheck)
  - Keep lines under 120 characters (lll)
  - Remove unused parameters or prefix with _ (revive)
  - Fix code formatting with gofmt before committing
  - Remove unused functions and dead code (unused)
  - Use proper variable naming (min 3 chars) (varnamelen)

  Development Practices:
  - Feature branch workflow with thorough code reviews
  - Container-first deployment with security hardening
  - Monitoring/observability integration
  - Cross-platform binary distribution via GoReleaser
